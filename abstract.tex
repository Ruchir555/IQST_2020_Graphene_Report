In this report we discuss the applications of graphene for quantum information applications. We begin by discussing the electronic and structural properties of graphene, and derive key properties of monolayer and bilayer graphene. We then discuss several nanoscale systems in the literature which have the potential to host single photon quantum emitters and/or spin-based defect states. Finally, DFT calculations for hexagonal boron nitride and graphene using \textit{Quantum Espresso} are presented. Overall, several promising optical systems are identified, however more quantitative analysis is needed to identify and characterize a suitable nanoscale atomic defect.
