    \textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
In this report we discuss the effects of dissipation dilution and strain engineering as relevant
to cavity optomechanics. We begin by discussing basic optomechanics theory, then review strain
engineering and dissipation dilution. Finally, we present some numerical simulation results done
in COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the effects of dissipation dilution and strain engineering
in mechanical resonators. We also present some alternative resonator designs and their advantages and
disadvantages over the tapered PnC design. The results obtained in COMSOL show signs of
approaching the mode shape required, however more work is required for this to accurately represent
the mode shape obtained by Ghadimi et al. for the tapered PnC nanobeams.
