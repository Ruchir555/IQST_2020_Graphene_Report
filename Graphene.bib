	abstract = {Recent developments in fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures enable new type of devices assembled by stacking atomically thin layers of two-dimensional materials. Using this approach, we fabricate light-emitting devices based on a monolayer WSe2, and also comprising boron nitride tunnelling barriers and graphene electrodes, and observe sharp luminescence spectra from individual defects in WSe2 under both optical and electrical excitation. This paves the way towards the realisation of electrically-pumped quantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors. In addition we demonstrate tuning by more than 1 meV of the emission energy of the defect luminescence by applying a vertical electric field. This provides an estimate of the permanent electric dipole created by the corresponding electronâ€“hole pair. The light-emitting devices investigated in our work can be assembled on a variety of substrates enabling a route to integration of electrically pumped single quantum emitters with existing technologies in nano-photonics and optoelectronics.}

It relies on the relationship between the local density of states in reciprocal space and the fully unfolded band structure. This provides an intuitive and valid approach not only for periodic, but also for systems with no translational symmetry. By refolding into the primitive Brillouin zone of the pristine crystal we recover the conventional unfolded bands. We implement our algorithm in the Siesta package. As an application, we study a set of benchmark examples, ranging from simple defects on crystals to systems with increasing complexity and of current interest, as the effect of external pressure on rotated graphene bilayers.}

	abstract = {The tight-binding method of modelling materials lies between the very accurate, very expensive, ab initio methods and the fast but limited empirical methods. When compared with ab initio methods, tight-binding is typically two to three orders of magnitude faster, but suffers from a reduction in transferability due to the approximations made; when compared with empirical methods, tight-binding is two to three orders of magnitude slower, but the quantum mechanical nature of bonding is retained, ensuring that the angular nature of bonding is correctly described far from equilibrium structures. Tight-binding is therefore useful for the large number of situations in which quantum mechanical effects are significant, but the system size makes ab initio calculations impractical.
	
	In this paper we review the theoretical basis of the tight-binding method, and the range of approaches used to exactly or approximately solve the tight-binding equations. We then consider a representative selection of the huge number of systems which have been studied using tight-binding, identifying the physical characteristics that favour a particular tight-binding method, with examples drawn from metallic, semiconducting and ionic systems. Looking beyond standard tight-binding methods we then review the work which has been done to improve the accuracy and transferability of tight-binding, and moving in the opposite direction we consider the relationship between tight-binding and empirical models.}

	abstract = { Layered materials are very attractive for studies of lightâ€“matter interactions at the nanoscale. In particular, isolated quantum systems such as color centers and quantum dots embedded in these materials are gaining interest due to their potential use in a variety of quantum technologies and nanophotonics. Here, we review the field of nonclassical light emission from van der Waals crystals and atomically thin two-dimensional materials. We focus on transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride and discuss the fabrication and properties of quantum emitters in these systems and proof-of-concept experiments that provide a foundation for their integration in on-chip nanophotonic circuits. These experiments include tuning of the emission wavelength, electrical excitation, and coupling of the emitters to waveguides, dielectric cavities, and plasmonic resonators. Finally, we discuss current challenges in the field and provide an outlook to further stimulate scientific discussion. }

	abstract = "In this chapter, we review the electronic properties of several two-dimensional (2D) material families, including multilayered systems. Several 2D materials are covered: graphene, silicene and other group-IV elements, phosphorene, transition metals dichalcogenides, and monochalcogenide-monolayers. An emphasis is given on the similarities and differences between families. We start by providing a short crystallographic and diffraction description, showing its importance as a general framework to understand the main features of charge-carrier propagation. Then we examine the theoretical tools needed to model the electronic properties, including Dirac and Weyl materials. A discussion is also presented concerning the importance of free-electron bands to describe interactions between graphene with substrates and polar liquids as water. Such tools allow one to describe a new playground for observing exotic matter phases, such as KekulÃ© patterns, moirÃ© patterns, graphene over graphene at magic angles, mixed Diracâ€“SchrÃ¶dinger electronic spectrum, and topological insulator states."

	abstract = "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are often called van der Waals materials because they typically have strong in-plane covalent bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals forces. For the unique structure of the van der Waals materials, they can form a stable structure as the materials are reducing to an atomically thin monolayer. Single-layer graphite called graphene has been produced by mechanical exfoliation method from highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. Since the discovery of graphene, many unique and superior properties of the material have been revealed. However, it has some limitations in the semiconductor applications due to its semimetallic character. The success of graphene research and lack of semiconductor property have led scientists to find other inorganic 2D materials beyond graphene. Researchers have revealed several different types of 2D semiconductor materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), phosphorene, and MXene. TMDs among the 2D semiconductor materials have attracted considerable attention as core materials of next-generation semiconductor devices due to their unique electrical, mechanical, chemical, and optical properties. This chapter discusses various methods to synthesize and to manipulate the properties of TMDs."
